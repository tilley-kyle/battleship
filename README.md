 ## BattleShip: The Board Game... Onlinified

> People who like games combining luck and strategy will get a kick out of this one.

> BattleShip: The Board Game... Onlinified is a strategy game pitting two players against eachother as they vie
>             for total control of the sea. They'll place their fleets spread across the board in a way that
>             will make it difficult for the other player to find. Taking turns they will guess a grid location
>             correlating to their apponents board hoping to strike a ship, and eventually sink their fleet before
>             their own get sunk.

> The problem that BattleShip: The Board Game... Onlinified is tackling is properly paying homage to a great game
>             thrown to the wayside with modern and more complicated games of today. Many don't realize Battleship
>             originated as the original Ender's Game during the conflicts of the early 20th century.
>             Unsuspecting officers in training were given the board game to practice ordering fleets movements and
>             attacks on the enemy. Officers in training were encouraged to rutheless and were so, not realizing they
>             were commanding real naval conflicts miles away. Since then Battleship has faded into obscurity, especially
>             following WWII when the aircraft carrier replaced the majestic battleship, patrolling the seas.

> We here at KATilleyTech think that notion is unacceptable. We will bring back Battleship and modernize it into

>             technologies!

> "Wow, I hope I'm not actually commanding a real fleet here! #nosurvivors" Said one happy customer after winning
>             her first game. We promise this is just fun!*

> Are you ready to dominate the seas? Are you ready to command the full power of hundreds of thousands of tons of diplaced
